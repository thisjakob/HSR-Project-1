# HSR-Project-1: Notes
"npm install" will install all modules

## to do
- create better ID than just a timestamp (some kind of short hash example: hj48i)
- add form validation
- [done] ~~render notes list~~
- [done] style switch
- [done] ~~add delete note~~
- [done] finish note
- [done] filter finished notes
- [done] expand / collapse dates and description
- sort notes by finished date / created date / importance

## Ideas for additional features
- undo delete note
- settings: last skin, last filter
- search text
- header fixed

## failure
